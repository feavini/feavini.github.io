The transformation and processing of grapes is completely carried out in our
wine cellars. The results are high quality wines with various aromas and
flavours that go from the most fruity and floral to the most structured
and full-bodied. Not only quality, but also research and innovation are at
the basis of our work. Near the “great classic” of the territory, such as
Barbera D’Asti, Barbera d’Asti Superior, Dolcetto and Nebbiolo, there are
new and researched wines with peculiar smells and characteristics. For
example the Rocca Fea, a blending of Nebbiolo and Gamba di Pernice, an
autochthonous vine variety, and the Moscato-Passito _Così… una
volta_.

The wine cellar has been recently renewed in order to bring to
lights the _crotin_, ancient underground cellar dug into the ground and used
in the past as place for the aging of wine and the conservation of
food. A visit to our cellar will permit you to take a step back in the past
and to bring back to memory the ancient farm traditions that still today
represent the basis of our work.
