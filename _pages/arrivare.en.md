the direction for Calosso/Costigliole d’Asti both at the first traffic circle
and at the next crossroad, then continue on the primary route SS456. After near
2 kilometres on the primary route SS456, near the left hairpin, take the
secondary route SP59 following the direction for Calosso/Costigliole
d’Asti/Santo Stefano Belbo. At the traffic light, continue ahead on the

kilometre; at the second bend on the left, near the railroad crossing, you will
